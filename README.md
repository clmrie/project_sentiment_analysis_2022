# Textual representations and semantic embeddings: an application for sentiment/essay analysis

In this project, we analyzed textual representations and semantic embeddings using datasets from https://www.trictrac.net/, a website that sells board games. <br>
The primary goal was to classify reviews and predict user sentiments (positive or negative). By correlating words with grades, we gained valuable insights and established meaningful connections between words and sentiments in the reviews, using word vector representation and dimensionality reduction. <br>
Through this exploration, we identified trends in customer preferences. <br><br>
