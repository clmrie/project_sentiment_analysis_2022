# Textual representations and semantic embeddings: an application for sentiment/essay analysis

This project involves the analysis of textual representations and semantic embeddings from datasets obtained from the website https://www.trictrac.net/, which focuses on selling board games.
The main objective is to classify reviews and predict the sentiment (positive or negative) expressed by users. We gained valuable insights by correlating words with grades, using word vector representation and dimensionality reduction to establish meaningful associations between words and sentiment in reviews. Exploring the represented space allows identifying trends in customer preferences.
